I need to develop an android app which does the following things

Requirements
1) I need this to be a demon program
2) when the os starts, need the code to start as well
3) when the code starts i need the following to be done
5) Need to record the up time, when the device was on.
6) To achieve this, when ever the os turns on, run the code,
every 5 min record the event for uptime.
7) aggregate the event over period of day.
